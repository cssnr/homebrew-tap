## Formula

| Name      | Repository                                        | Description                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `npmstat` | [cssnr/npmstat](https://github.com/cssnr/npmstat) | NPM Package Stats and Info CLI |

## Usage

First you must tap the keg (so only 21+ in the USA)...

```shell
brew tap cssnr/tap
```

Then you can install a formula.

```shell
brew install npmstat
```

For naming conflicts, use the full name.

```shell
brew install cssnr/tap/npmstat
```

To update, first update all the formulas.

```shell
brew update
```

Then you can update a formula with install.

```shell
brew install npmstat
```

Alternatively, you can also force a re-installation.

```shell
brew reinstall npmstat
```

However, if your goal was to upgrade all installed formula.

```shell
brew upgrade
```

## Facts

- 2014 - I said homebrew is going to be big...
- 2025 - I still don't know anyone using it, but...
- 2025 (hours later) - I get it now... Caveat emptor!
